## Usage



## About

The game consits of 16 positions and 15 tiles in a 4x4 grid. 

The aim of the game is to move the tiles around so they appear in numerial order (left to right, top to bottom). The empty space should end up in the bottom right position.

Tiles can only be moved if they touch the empty space.

The game has three difficulty levels which limit the number of moves the player has to complete the puzzle.

## Extra
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The inital code was taken from the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). By starting here the basis of a tic-tac-toe game could be used to then setup the 15 title basics.
