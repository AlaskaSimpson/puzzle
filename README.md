# 15 Tile Puzzle

## Description
A take on the traditional 15 tile puzzle. Consiting of 15 numbered tiles to arrange in the grid instead of unjumbling a picture. Built as part of Mintbean Hackathon #083.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The inital code was taken from the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). By starting here the basis of a tic-tac-toe game could be used to then setup the 15 title basics.
