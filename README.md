## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The inital code was taken from the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). By starting here the basis of a tic-tac-toe game could be used to then setup the 15 title basics.
